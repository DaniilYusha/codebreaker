  spec.summary       = %q{
                          Codebreaker is a logic game in which a code-breaker tries
                          to break a secret code created by a code-maker. The codemaker,
                          which will be played by the application weâ€™re going to write,
                          creates a secret code of four numbers between 1 and 6.
                        }
  spec.description   = %q{
                          The codebreaker gets some number of chances to break the code (depends on chosen difficulty).
                          In each turn, the codebreaker makes a guess of 4 numbers.
                          The codemaker then marks the guess with up to 4 signs - + or - or empty spaces.
                          A + indicates an exact match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers
                          in the secret code and in the same position.
                          A - indicates a number match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers
                          in the secret code but in a different position.
                          An empty space indicates that there is not a current digit in a secret number.
                          If codebreaker inputs the exact number as a secret number - codebreaker wins the game.
                          If all attempts are spent - codebreaker loses.
                          Codebreaker also has some number of hints(depends on chosen difficulty).
                          If a user takes a hint - he receives back a separate digit of the secret code.
